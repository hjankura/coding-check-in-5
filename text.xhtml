    <h2>Recipes</h2>
      <p>You can make exactly as good cakes, pies, cookies, and candies by substituting for the butter named in your recipes 3/4 the
      quantity of Swift's Premium Oleomargarine. On this and the
      following pages are a few recipes in which this substitution has
      been made. Try them. You will find them good and more economical
      than when made with butter.</p>

      <p>You may have some favorite recipes that are too expensive on account
      of the large amount of butter required. You can reduce their cost
      by using Swift's Premium Oleomargarine.</p>


      <h3>Loaf Fig Cake</h3>

        <h4>Light Part</h4>

          1/2 cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine
          1/2 cupful sweet milk
          1-1/2 teaspoonfuls baking-powder
          1 cupful sugar
          1-1/2 cupfuls flour
          1 teaspoonful vanilla
          Whites of 4 eggs

          Cream the oleomargarine and sugar. Add the milk, with which the
              vanilla has been mixed. Sift the baking-powder with the flour and
              add gradually. Add the whites, well beaten, last.

        <h4>Dark Part</h4>

          1/2 cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine
          3/4 cupful milk
          1-1/2 teaspoonfuls baking-powder
          Yolks of 4 eggs
          1/2 pound of raisins
          1-1/2 cupfuls sugar
          3 cupfuls flour
          1 dessertspoonful each of cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and nutmeg
          1 pound of figs

          Cream the oleomargarine and sugar. Add the egg-yolks, well beaten,
              then the milk. Sift the baking-powder and spices with the flour
              and add gradually. The raisins should be seeded and dredged with
              flour, and the figs should be cut in small pieces and dredged
              with flour and added to the batter the last thing. Put in the pan
              alternate layers of each part and bake in a loaf.

        <h3>Sugar Cookies</h3>

          1 cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine
          1 cupful sour milk
          1 teaspoonful soda
          2 cupfuls sugar
          3 eggs, well beaten
          Flavoring to taste
          Flour enough to roll out thin

          Cream the oleomargarine and sugar. Add the eggs, whites and yolks
              beaten together. Dissolve the soda in the sour milk. Add this and
              then the flour. Roll out thin. Just before cutting out the
              cookies sift granulated sugar on top and roll it in slightly,
              then cut out cookies with cookie-cutter and bake in a moderate
              oven.
